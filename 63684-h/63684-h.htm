<h3>PART XII.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the commencement of these papers we
attempted to describe the growth of English
villages and their origin as the surrounding
adjuncts of the villa, or residence of the proprietor
of the district, or lord of the soil. In
Roman times this residence was called a villa;
in Saxon and Norman times it
became a castle, and after that
important wave of civilisation
which passed over this country
in the 13th century, curtailing
the power of the barons, it
became “the manor house.”
Now although the manor
house of the 14th century was
a less formidable building than
the Norman castle, it was
generally an important structure,
and at times possessed
considerable architectural
beauty. Very few early manor
houses are perfect now, or in
any way complete, as they
were nearly ruined, if not
destroyed, during the “Wars
of the Roses.” Sometimes,
however, we may still trace
fragments of them attached
to modern cottages or houses.
The finest fragment of the
kind we know is to be seen at
the little village of Arminghall,
about ten miles from
Norwich. A cottage or small
farmhouse here possesses a
doorway which is, perhaps,
the finest example of domestic
Gothic architecture in the
country. It is improbable
that it was originally intended
to serve its present use as an
entrance to a cottage porch,
and the traditions of the
place point to its having been
a fragment of an ancient
manor house, called by the
people “The Old Hall.”
Little or nothing seems to be
known about it, and if it really
did form a portion of some
ancient mansion, with the
solitary exception of this arch,
everything else has disappeared.
As will be seen from
our sketch, it is a very elaborate work of remarkable
design, and from its style there can be
little doubt that it dates from the reign of
Edward III. Between the mouldings which
enclose the arch runs a broad band of carved
foliage chiefly representing a vine, with lizards
looking through the leaves. On either side of
the arch are very elaborate niches in two
ranges filled with statues of knights and
ladies. Delicately-treated pinnacles and finials
adorn these niches, and the whole work is
remarkable for elegance and most finished
workmanship, somewhat resembling the fragment
of the hall of the bishop’s palace at
Norwich. The inner doorway of the porch
forms no portion of this beautiful work, as it
is late Tudor, and the curious slabs over the
doorway look like seventeenth century carvings.
Now whether this magnificent doorway
is a portion of some mansion which was completed
at the same time, or whether no portion
of the architectural scheme, except the doorway,
was carried out, or, what is perhaps still
more probable, whether after the work had
been abandoned for centuries, it was again
resumed, and carried out in a much plainer
and less costly style, of which the inner doorway
is the only existing portion, it is quite
impossible to say. However the case may
be, there can be no doubt that this cottage at
Arminghall has the most
beautiful doorway of a house
in England. There is nothing
whatever of interest in the
cottage itself apart from its
entrance.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">A MODERN COTTAGE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Manor houses of the Tudor
times are by no means uncommon
in our English villages,
but it should be pointed
out that most of the mansions
erected in what is called the
“Elizabethan style” are really
works of the time of James I.,
or that of Charles I.</p>

<p>We have now completed
our task of describing the
cottages and other architectural
objects in English villages
as they existed in bygone
times, a few have escaped destruction
down to our own
day, but it is too much to be
feared even these will, in a
few years, have ceased to
exist. The last half century,
over which our personal recollection
extends, has witnessed
such a vast amount
of destruction that it is difficult
to believe in anything remaining
at the end of another
half century.</p>

<p>The fact is, railways, competition,
machinery, the concentration
of our “industrial
classes” in large cities, the
gradual extinction of the
yeoman class, and the difficulty
to obtain a bare subsistence
as a small tenant farmer,
have completely changed the
condition of country life, and
if we are ever again to have
pretty villages they will be
inhabited by ladies and gentlemen
glad to escape occasionally
from the toil of town
life, and to recruit themselves in pretty
cottages amidst charming scenery, pleasant
gardens, and all the sweetness of a country
life without its sordid toil, losses and vexations.
We give a view of a home of this kind situated
amidst the exquisite scenery of the Surrey hills
as a pattern cottage of the future.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">n</span> this hour of domestic
desertion,
Miss Latimer, remembering
Mrs. Grant’s
injunction,
allowed Lucy
to do most of
the necessary housework,
while she herself
undertook the outdoor
errands and the function
of “answering”
the door bell.</p>

<p>A letter duly arrived
from Clementina’s relatives
at Hull. It said
little more than the telegram, save that
she had come there very “worn out and
ill,” having found her place “too trying”
for her. She would have to take “a
long rest.” It was requested that her
box should be packed up and forwarded
“along with the month’s wage due to
her.”</p>

<p>Clementina had taken her departure
when only twenty days of that “month”
had elapsed. But Lucy resolved to take
no notice of that fact, but to send the
full sum. She herself packed the box
and despatched it. She found therein
about half a packet of mourning envelopes
of such singular width of border
that she showed them to Miss Latimer
and Mr. Somerset, who, however, kept
their own counsel on this head. Lucy
did not accept Mr. Somerset’s advice
about the letter in which she enclosed
her postal order. He wished her to
ignore all that had been discovered
since Clementina’s departure and to let
the whole matter drop. Lucy could not
accept this as her duty. As soon as
she knew of Clementina’s safety and
whereabouts, she had telegraphed to
Mrs. Bray’s Rachel, that her mind too
might be set at ease about her old
acquaintance. In return she had received
a very simple, straightforward
letter from Rachel, expressing sincere
regret that all this trouble had been
caused to Mrs. Challoner through
one whom she had introduced. She
reiterated the perfect respectability of
the Gillespies and the high esteem in
which they had been held in their own
neighbourhood. Rachel was naturally
deeply concerned about Clementina herself.
“People can’t help going out of
their mind,” she wrote, “but then it
ought to be somebody’s duty to keep
them from troubling others or disgracing
themselves.”</p>

<p>The same point impressed Lucy. She
felt herself bound to tell the plain truth to
those who were now harbouring Clementina,
and whose actions might decide that
unhappy woman’s future course. Tom
was inclined to say, “Let them find her
out for themselves, as we had to do”—a
blunt egotism which didn’t influence
Lucy for a moment. Mr. Somerset gave
counsels of reticence, but did not support
them by any moral reasons. In fact he
candidly admitted, “I am thinking chiefly
of you, Mrs. Challoner, and advising you
for your own sake. I don’t want you
to have any more trouble. I know how—in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred—such
a warning as you wish to give
will be received.”</p>

<p>That decided Lucy. If something was
right to do, then she was not to be
withheld by any self-consideration from
doing it.</p>

<p>“How should I feel,” she asked, “if
some morning I open the newspaper
and find that Clementina has taken
another situation and has perhaps killed
a baby or set a house on fire? It would
be bad enough if she only made others
suffer as we have done; but of merely
that, of course, we should never hear.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘To care for others that they may not suffer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As we have suffered is divine well-doing,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The noblest vote of thanks for all our sorrows,’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>quoted Miss Latimer, “and I’ve often
seen that work in many ways which
shallow sentimentalists do not recognise.”</p>

<p>“I know that few lunatics who eventually
fall into terrible crime have not
given forewarnings which, if heeded,
might have spared them and their victims,”
Mr. Somerset conceded. “But
still, under all the circumstances, I feel
as if it is our first duty to consider Mrs.
Challoner and to save her from the
abuse and insult which her interference
on this score may probably bring.”</p>

<p>But Lucy determined on her course,
and she wrote a brief account of what
had happened during Clementina’s stay
and had been discovered since her
departure.</p>

<p>“At best there will be no answer,”
remarked Mr. Somerset.</p>

<p>“That will be very rude,” said Miss
Latimer.</p>

<p>“I shall be quite satisfied with that,”
returned the gentleman significantly.</p>

<p>They were still awaiting developments
when, a morning or two afterwards, the
door bell summoned Miss Latimer to
receive a bright-faced, pleasant-voiced
woman, who inquired for “Mrs. Challoner,”
and asked to be announced as
“‘Mrs. May from Deal—Jarvist May’s
widow.’ Mrs. Challoner will recollect
me.”</p>

<p>No announcement was needed. Lucy,
who, according to her new nervous
habit, had been listening on the stairs,
was instantly sobbing in the arms of
this woman, who had gone through all
the worst which Lucy had to fear. The
blessed tears had come!</p>

<p>To “Jarvist May’s widow” Lucy
found it easy to confide the fears—nay,
the absolute despair—which now filled
her concerning Charlie’s fate. To none
of the others had she done this. They
had tendered their hopes to her, and
she, little knowing how faint they felt
them, had made as though she could at
least entertain these. In that way they
had sought to comfort her, and she had
accepted their kind intention, even as
gentle hearts accept the little useless
gifts of childish good-will. But this
widowed woman brought consolation up
from great depths lying calm beneath
whatever wind might rise.</p>

<p>“God has got you, and God has got
your husband, wherever he is. How
can you be apart, my dear? Why,
dear, if God has taken him to Himself,
he may be nearer to you now than in
the days when he was living here and
had to go out to his business, leaving
you at home. And if he’s still somewhere
on earth, dear, don’t you hope
he’s taking care of himself and keeping
bright and cheery in the faith that you
are doing the same? If he is living
and can’t send word to you, that must
feel as bad for him as for you to get no
word. Don’t you hope that he trusts
you are keeping up? And as he is certainly
all right—<span class="allsmcap">SOMEWHERE</span>—you’ve
just got to keep up for his sake. Yes,
my dear, cry, cry”—as Lucy looked up
with a piteous attempt to smile. “He
wouldn’t mind that so long as it does
you good and washes the clouds out of
your heart. That’s what tears are
meant for—to make us smile the sweeter
afterwards.”</p>

<p>Mrs. May’s visit rose out of her
having seen the newspaper paragraph
concerning the safety of the <i>Slains
Castle</i>.</p>

<p>“I came away to see you just as soon
as I could,” she narrated simply.
“Thought I, poor dear, she’s got to go
through for months the waiting and
the watching that I had only for a few
hours. All I can say to her is, that I
know what those few hours were, and
that none but God could have helped me
through them, and none but God can help
her through her longer trial. But that’s
enough, for God is over everything, and
under everything, and in everything; and
if He upholds you, so does everything
else.”</p>

<p>She joined with Mrs. Grant’s counsel,
in whispering to Miss Latimer that
nothing would be so good for Lucy as to
proceed with her “regular work,” to keep
her life on in a straight line from where
her husband left her, and not to have to
face any “beginning again.” She was
actually glad to find that Lucy’s present
absence from her classes arose from a
sheer practical necessity, and not from
any yielding to grief.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. May had a most unexpected
proposal to make. It appeared that she
had let her house furnished for a whole
year to people who were to provide their
own service. She had not quite relished
doing this, as it deprived her of her
“work,” but she had felt she ought not
to refuse a good offer, since her last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_788"></a>{788}</span>
season had been as a whole but a poor
one, while her strength had somewhat
failed under a great rush of summer
visitors for a few short weeks.</p>

<p>“So I thought I would go into rooms
in Deal, and make myself as useful as I
could among my neighbours,” she said.
“I thought to myself it might even be a
bit of training against old age. I do
pray I may be of use to somebody till my
dying day. But it’s in God’s hands, and
when I’ve seen old folks kept alive so long
and so helpless that others talk about
‘a happy release,’ it has come into my
mind that, after all, maybe God is
giving them their rest on this side of the
grave instead of the other, and that they’ll
be off and up and about their Master’s
business, while some who have been
working to the end here will be getting
their bit of sleep in Paradise.”</p>

<p>When Mrs. May heard of Lucy’s household
predicament, a fresh thought had
come into her head; and so her suggestion
was that she herself should take up
her abode in the little house with the
verandah, and by “keeping it going”
lift a weight of care from its young
mistress’s mind.</p>

<p>“I won’t take any wages,” she said.
“No, please, I’d rather not. There’s a
good income for me for this year at least
from my furnished house. After that we
might speak of the matter again, when
we see how things go—but not before—no,
I’ll not hear of it. For, you see,
dear Mrs. Challoner, work may be a
little harder in this London house than
by the sunny sea-shore, and I may
need a little help from the outside, and
there will be that for you to pay for. I
feel you may well look a little downcast
at the thought of outside help, for I
know the trouble it often gives even in a
quiet town, to say nothing of London.
But you see I shall be always to the
fore, as you could not be yourself; and I
am different from young servants, who are
often corrupted by charwomen. When a
body works with another, one soon finds
out what that other is, and how far one’s
confidence may go. And we won’t be in
any hurry to engage anybody. Maybe
we shall just come across the right
person.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, “the right
person” was actually preparing to cross
London even while Mrs. May was
speaking. Only a hour or two afterwards
she presented herself at Mrs.
Challoner’s door in the person of her old
servant, Pollie!</p>

<p>Pollie did not look quite so blooming
as in the days of her service. She had
a little baby in her arms. She was
candidly crying. She too had seen the
sad news of the <i>Slains Castle</i> in the
newspaper—her husband had read it to
her at breakfast time, and with the
rashness of youth and ignorance she
had thought the very worst was inevitable.
Miss Latimer called Mrs.
May to talk to her for awhile before
Lucy was told of her arrival. A little
talk with the sailor’s widow restored
Pollie to calmness and to some modified
hope.</p>

<p>“I often wondered why I never heard
from you,” said Lucy to her old servant.
“If I had known you were again in
London, I should have come to see
you.”</p>

<p>“Would you really, ma’am?” cried
Pollie, delighted. “I thought you were
so angry with me for leaving you.”</p>

<p>“No, Pollie,” Lucy answered, “I
was not angry, and I am very sorry
indeed if I seemed so. I was bitterly
disappointed and vexed because I had
not dreamed of your leaving, and it
meant taking everything up in a
different way from what I had thought.
I was under a terrible strain too at that
time, so that any added pressure made
me cry out, and it may have seemed
like anger when it was only pain.”</p>

<p>“I know that what I did didn’t look
pretty,” Pollie admitted. “I’ve seen
that since. But I was in a fine taking.
I’d got it into my head there would be
changes and that I’d be turned loose
of a sudden, and I knew that it wasn’t
every place that would suit me after
I’d been so long with you and the
master. And husband, after he knew
more, he didn’t comfort me nor speak
no smooth things. I said you were
huffed at my marrying, and he thought
that was unreasonable——”</p>

<p>“As it would have been,” interjected
Lucy.</p>

<p>“But when it came out how you had
been situated with the master going
away, and how good you’d been to my
sisters, when they were so weakly, then
husband sang another tune. ‘Them
that considers our families,’ says he,
‘we ought to consider theirs, leastways
unless we’re such poor stuff that we
must be always a-getting and never
a-giving.’ And I’m sure I needn’t
have been in such a hurry; he’d have
waited a bit if I’d promised him,
’twasn’t his own changing he was
feared of but mine! And we’ve never
got rightly settled, and the poor baby’s
suffered a good deal with the moving
about, and me getting so tired and
worried.”</p>

<p>“But it is a dear little baby,” Lucy
said, stroking the grave little white
face. “I am so glad to see it, Pollie.
It is so kind of you to bring it.”</p>

<p>Pollie was tearful again.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a favour to ask, ma’am,”
she said. “We’ve never hit on a name
for him yet, and says husband to me,
after he read that bit of troublesome
news in the paper—‘I wonder if your
mistress would let us call him after your
master. It would show her that we did
know who is good folks, though we
didn’t always act like it.’ That’s the
best of husband,” Pollie explained,
wiping away her tears. “When there’s
anything he thinks a bit wrong, he never
puts it on ‘you,’ he always says ‘we.’
And says I to him, ‘I’ll go straight off
and ask her, and if she thinks it’s too
much of a liberty, I’ll ask if she’d like
better that we named the boy after her
son, little Master Hugh, God bless
him!’”</p>

<p>Lucy’s own eyes were full of tears.
She had taken the baby and was
pressing it to her bosom.</p>

<p>“Call him after Charlie,” she sobbed.
“Call him—Charlie. Charlie had Hugh
named after my father—and now if
Charlie—if——” she could not complete
her sentence, but added with a great
effort—“there will never be a Charlie
Challoner of my own.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Pollie,” she went on presently,
“the terrible part of your leaving was
that I felt Charlie must not know about
it. I do believe he would not have gone
for this voyage if he had not firmly
believed that you and I could go on
happily and safely while he was away.
I hated to keep the secret, Pollie, but I
had to do it, if Charlie was to have what
seemed to be such a chance for his life.
And now, after all——” she could say
no more.</p>

<p>“And I daresay the master thought
pretty hardly of me when he did hear,”
said Pollie woefully.</p>

<p>“He never heard,” answered Lucy.
“I meant to tell him so soon as I got
comfortably settled down with somebody
else. But that day never came while he
was in reach of letters. Once I thought
all was so right that I began my letter,
telling the whole story, but before it was
finished there was disappointment, and
that letter never went. To Charlie it
must always seem as if Pollie is taking
care of Hugh and me.”</p>

<p>“I only wish it could be true!” cried
Pollie. “I only wish I could afford to
come over twice a week and help that
nice person who tells me she is going to
look after your house. I could bring
the baby with me, for he is as good as
gold.”</p>

<p>Lucy looked up; a bright thought
struck her.</p>

<p>“The question is, Pollie,” she said,
“could you afford the time? A married
woman owes all her time to her
husband’s home, except under peculiar
circumstances or at a pinch. And I’m
sure it is wisest and best so, Pollie, for
if a wife’s earnings are not simply an
‘extra,’ evoked to meet some special
visitation of God, they don’t add to the
household prosperity and comfort. I’m
sure I’ve seen enough this year to prove
that.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I know it’s true, ma’am,” said
Pollie, “but what you say is just our
case. Husband had an accident last
spring and was out of work three
months, and on only half work for a
while after, and what with him bringing
in nothing, and wanting dainty food,
and with a doctor’s bill to pay, we got
into debt, and before we left the place
we had to pay off, and that meant
‘putting away’ a lot of our things.
We’re only in one room now, ma’am,
and that does not suit the ways of either
of us, and that room is bare enough and
does not take long to keep clean. And
while I might be helping to get things
right again, there I sit with a heavy
heart and empty hands. That’s when
women take to mischief—to gossiping
and drinking. Tom’s out from
seven in the morning till six at night.
But, of course, I can’t do anything
that would take me away from my
baby. I wouldn’t do that, and Tom
wouldn’t hear of it, not while we have a
crust of bread to eat.”</p>

<p>“But, Pollie,” said Lucy, “if you
can really afford the time, I can afford
to pay you—I really can,” she assured
her former servant, seeing that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_789"></a>{789}</span>
looked pitifully at her. “First of all, I
earn a good deal by my work, if I can
get a trustworthy person to work for me
in turn; and secondly, my good friend
Mrs. May, whom you have seen, refuses
to take any wages, because she says
she knows she will want outside help.
I could afford, Pollie, to give you six
shillings a week if you will come
here for two days weekly from eight
till four, and of course you would dine
here.”</p>

<p>“Why, that would pay our rent!”
cried Pollie joyfully. “And I know
what working in a nice house like this
is, with a proper sitting down to good
food. Husband, he said to me, ‘If
you go charing, it’ll just be cleaning up
after slovenly hussies and getting meals
o’ broken meat.’ Won’t he be pleased!
And, oh, Mrs. Challoner, this makes
me quite sure you are friends with me
again. I only wish I’d been reasonable,
and had treated you friendly, and taken
counsel with you, and not been so
sudden-like. Yet there’s some ladies
make a servant believe she’s of no
account, and girls are too ready to
listen to ’em,” added Pollie, with a side
glance of memory at that conversation
with Mrs. Brand which had so disturbed
and unsettled her. “But now I’m sure
we’re friends again, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to have ever led you to
think otherwise,” said Lucy. “I was
sad and sore myself, and it hurt me to
think that, after all the time we had
been together——”</p>

<p>“And all you’d done for me and my
folks,” murmured Pollie.</p>

<p>“You should act so suddenly in such
an important matter, with no reference
to me or my trying position,” Mrs.
Challoner went on. “Perhaps, in my
turn, I was not considerate enough of
your standpoint. Anyhow, Pollie, as
you say, now we know we are friends
again.”</p>

<p>That was a pleasant interlude. Better
even than its immediate comfort and
security was the mystic hint that it
seemed to convey not only of a far-off
greater “restitution of all things,” but
also of a present protecting power—that
Fatherly love which takes us up when,
in the ways of life or of death, parents
and spouses and friends forsake or fail
us. “Goodness and mercy shall follow
us all the days of our life.” We have
to walk forward in that faith, and only
by such walking forward can faith be
transformed into sacred, secret knowledge.</p>

<p>It was well, indeed, that there was
something pleasant. For, alas for
human nature, it is by foreseeing evil
as to its doings that one can most easily
establish reputation as a far-seeing
prophet!</p>

<p>Some days passed before the arrival
of Clementina’s box and the receipt of
the postal order were acknowledged
from Hull. Then a little parcel came.</p>

<p>“I should not wonder but the poor
soul, if she has come a little to her
senses, has sent some bit of her needlework
as a peace-offering,” observed
Mrs. Challoner as she unfastened the
string.</p>

<p>Far from it! The parcel contained
only the half-used packet of mourning
envelopes and a letter. It was a comfort
to see that the epistle was by
another and an apparently saner hand.</p>

<p>The letter was not very long. It
began—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mrs. Challoner</span>,—The trunk has
come to hand. We had to pay a man
sixpence extra for bringing it up. Your
letter and post-office order have come.
We see you pay only for the current
month. Considering our niece was wore
out at your place and had to leave
through illness caused there, we think
you might have done a little more. Our
niece says these envelopes don’t belong
to her, and she doesn’t want to take
away anything that isn’t hers. She
says she never knew such goings on as
there were at your place, and if the
pore dear had gone out of her mind it
wouldn’t have been no wonder. Maybe
it is someone else as is out of their
mind. Our niece has got a little means
of her own, and needn’t go to service
except where she is valued. She won’t
go anywhere till she’s got back the
strength she lost in your place, and she
won’t come back to you on no account.</p>

<p>
<span class="ml2">“Yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap ml4">“Sarah Ann Micklewrath.”</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>At another time the falseness, the
selfishness, the greed, the utter injustice
of that letter would have pained Lucy.
It scarcely hurt her now. She showed
it to Miss Latimer, and Mr. Somerset,
and Mrs. May, and they were all indignant;
but as for Lucy, she only
smiled dimly.</p>

<p>“We have done all we can,” she
said. “We can’t do any more. And
we must not judge these Micklewraths
too harshly. We do not know how
sane and reasonable Clementina may
appear to them, just as she did to us.
I should not have been readily incredulous
of any story Clementina might have
told me about any of our tradespeople
or neighbours.”</p>

<p>It was a suspicious circumstance that
Clementina’s nearest relations at Inverslain
preserved a dead silence so far as
the little house with the verandah was
concerned. It appeared, however, that
they wrote to Mrs. Bray’s Rachel. She
forwarded their letter to Mrs. Challoner.
It, too, was brief and guarded, but was
quite different in its tone. It was written
by Clementina’s brother, who deplored
the trouble his sister had given everybody—“precisely
as she did when
she left the Highlands without telling
us where she was going or what she
meant to do. She is an excitable
woman,” he added, “who dwells on
things too much and takes violent fancies.”
His conclusion was that, “as
her aunt and uncle at Hull had taken
her in—which was more than he and
his wife would dare do, owing to Clementina’s
temper—he hoped they would
look after her, and she might quiet
down after a bit.”</p>

<p>Poor Rachel was quite self-accusatory
at the sad failure of her “introduction,”
though really it was hard to see how
she could blame herself, since her
recommendation had not gone one whit
beyond very good and reasonable
grounds, known to herself. She ended
her letter by saying—</p>

<p>“I fear my dear mistress is very ill
indeed. I don’t think she believes it of
herself. At least, she doesn’t wish us
to know she believes it. I don’t imagine
she will live to return to her old house.
I don’t think she could be moved from
here. I shouldn’t be surprised myself
if the end came at any moment. Mr.
and Mrs. Brand have been most kind.
My mistress quite looks forward to see
them at almost every week’s end.”</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the luxurious house Marjorie and Sadie
did not miss their mother as Ada did; indeed
it was a delightful change for them to have so
much of their sister’s society. She was more
amusing than their mother, and understood
their games better. When they heard that
their mother had gone away to a hospital to
be taken care of and made well again they
said they were “dreadfully sorry,” but that was
partly because sister Ada looked so sad, and
partly because it was polite to say so. About
a week after her mother had left her home
Ada was startled one evening by the old
butler, an Englishman, coming up to her
while she was waiting for her father to come
down to dinner, and saying in a hushed voice,
“Will you wait any longer, miss? I don’t
think the master will come home to dinner.”</p>

<p>“Then serve it at once,” Ada said; “but
why do you think he will not return?”</p>

<p>“He left the house last night, miss, after
you had gone to bed, and he has not been
seen since.”</p>

<p>Ada’s heart stood still. “Not been seen
since! What do you mean? Has he not been
at his office? Perhaps he is with my
mother?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, miss. Have you not
seen the evening papers?” The man held a
copy behind his back, Ada heard it rustle.</p>

<p>“Give it me,” she cried, as she put one
hand on the handsomely carved pedestal
which held a statue of the dancing fawn to
steady herself.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, miss, to be the one to hand it
to you, but the whole city knows it by this
time. It can’t be hid from you much longer.”</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with a kindly pity
in her eyes. She was sorrier for him at that
moment than for herself. He was a faithful
old servant who had been with them since
she was a baby. He handed her the paper
and went softly from the room, having the
delicacy to feel that it was not the place even
of an old servant to see his young mistress’s
sorrow.</p>

<p>“He’s a low skunking hound,” he said to
himself, “if he is my master, to leave the
pretty bit of a creature like that with those
two children on her hands. Whatever will
happen to them, I don’t know. There’s
about enough money in the house to pay off
all these miserable servants, and not much
more. It’s the dirtiest trick I ever saw played.
It was the disgrace and shock that sent his
poor wife off her head, him living like a prince
while he’s been defrauding poor widows and
children.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About a month from that day pretty Ada
Nicoli, who had been brought up to look upon
herself as an heiress, started out through the
city of New York to try and find some means
of livelihood for herself and her two little
sisters. Her mother’s little fortune brought
in just enough money to pay for her residence
in the comfortable asylum to which she had
gone before the terrible exposure of Mr.
Nicoli’s failure had been made public, and to
pay the weekly board for Ada and her two
sisters at a plain middle-class boarding-house
in East Thirty-second Street.</p>

<p>Ada had tried offering herself as a music
teacher, for she played well and liked music,
but wherever she went she was asked whom
she had studied under, and if she had been
taught in Germany. So to-day she was bent
on another mission. She had put her pride
still further down in her pocket, but unconsciously
her pretty chin was tilted a little
higher. She had to walk now—her tender
feet were tired and weary—where she had once
dashed along in a smart carriage. When she
arrived at a part of the town which was little
occupied by shops her steps slackened. She
was thinking what she would say when she
reached Madame Maude’s, the fashionable
milliner from whom she had been accustomed
to buy her hats. Madame Maude had only
one window to her shop, which was curtained
and lined with red velvet. The simple sailor
hat, one black toque, and a white feather boa
displayed in it gave the ignorant public little
idea of the fact that almost every time the
door bell rang to admit a customer, it meant
that Madame Maude was fifty dollars the
richer. Ada stopped a moment and looked
at the window. How often she had gone
with her mother to the shop and come away
with some pretty flowery hat without even
asking the price of it. And now she sighed,
for the price of one of those hats would pay
for a term of Marjorie’s lessons at school.
They must be educated, the girl cried in her
heart, and they must be brought up as her
mother’s children ought to be, even if they
had to work afterwards. She would not let
them grow up as shop-girls from childhood.
She opened the door and found herself inside
the shop with no words ready to meet the
question of the young girl who came forward.</p>

<p>“Can I see Madame Maude?” she asked
nervously. “I wish to speak to her alone.”</p>

<p>The girl stared at Ada’s perfectly-fitting
dress, robbed of all its luxurious trimmings, as
being unsuitable for her present position.
Madame Maude came forward and told the girl
to retire.</p>

<p>“What can I do for you?” she said kindly;
she knew that the large bill still standing in
Mrs. Nicoli’s name would never be paid, but
Mrs. Nicoli had been a good customer in the
days gone by, and for once a woman was
grateful for favours past.</p>

<p>“You have heard of our sad trouble,” Ada
began, “the world has painted it even blacker
than it is, so there is no need for me to tell
you what a terrible position I am in. I must
make money somehow. I have tried in so
many ways and failed. I came to ask you
if you knew of any position in a business
house that I could fill. I would not mind
how hard I worked.” She looked so unlike
hard work that Madame Maude’s heart
was touched by her appeal which was so
pathetically ignorant.</p>

<p>“What can you do?” she said, wondering
what the girl called “hard work.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Ada replied in a shamefaced
way, “for I have never tried, but I think
I could learn millinery very quickly.”</p>

<p>“My dear child,” the elder woman said,
“you don’t know what you are saying. Do
you know that my best hand was apprenticed
for three years before she received a dollar;
the next year she got a little more than a
dollar a week, the fifth year she went to Paris
and studied for a year and a half. She is not
only a milliner but an artist; it takes years
to acquire the knowledge, and I pay her accordingly.
My hats are not made by girls
who have trimmed up their old hats at home.”</p>

<p>Ada looked crestfallen. “I never thought
of all that; I only know that your hats are
always in perfect taste.”</p>

<p>Madame Maude had been looking at her
while she spoke. “If you won’t be offended,
I’ll make you an offer,” she said.</p>

<p>Ada bent her head in answer. She was
willing to sweep the floors if she had been
asked. She had spent her last dollar, and the
washing-bill was not paid for last week, and
Sadie had started a bad cough which demanded
a tonic, and tonics have to be paid for.</p>

<p>“If you will come here and act as saleswoman,”
Madame Maude said, “I will pay you
well.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind of you!” the girl cried.
“Of course I can’t be offended.” It was
such a nice, quiet little shop, quite a private
house; there was nothing to shock her in the
suggestion.</p>

<p>“Stop a bit,” Madame Maude said, “till
you hear what that means. I won’t pay you
fifteen dollars a week for merely handing a
customer a hat, and telling her the price—you’ve
got to make her buy it.”</p>

<p>“How can I?” Ada said, in a mystified
voice.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” Madame Maude explained;
and she took a lovely hat from a drawer, and
put it on her own head. Her face was broad
and homely, and the hat did not suit her
either well or badly.</p>

<p>“Look at me in this hat,” she said, “and
imagine I am the customer.”</p>

<p>Ada looked.</p>

<p>“Now look at yourself in it,” and she
placed the hat on Ada’s head of shining
hair.</p>

<p>Ada smiled, a half-pleased, half-bashful
smile.</p>

<p>“Now when the customer says she does not
think the hat will do—she is afraid it does not
suit her—and you have seen that it is <i>the</i> hat
she is hankering after, say quite casually, ‘I’m
sorry, madam, you don’t like it,’ and put it
on your own head. Move about the room in
it, and let her see how charming it is. In a
few moments she will have forgotten how she
herself looked in it, and will fondly imagine
that she will look like you, and the hat is sold.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_791"></a>{791}</span></p>

<p>Ada’s face had fallen.</p>

<p>“Will you do it?” Madame Maude said.
“It will be money easily earned; my saleswoman
is leaving next week.”</p>

<p>“I am to make money by my face,” Ada
cried, with a choking voice; “it’s so horrible.”
But something was saying to her, “You must
have money; you have spent your last dollar,
except what will pay for your bare board.
The children must go to school, and Sadie
wants a tonic. She has a cough because she
has been denied the luxuries she has been
used to, and has had to walk to school in all
sorts of weather.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will come,” she said; “but what
if I do not sell them as you expect?”</p>

<p>“I will risk that,” the woman said kindly,
“for I know the value of a pretty face below
a forty-dollar hat.”</p>

<p>When Ada found herself once again on
Fifth Avenue, she could scarcely believe she
was the same girl who had lived in the magnificent
mansion at the other end of the town
a few months ago, and had spent all her days
in light-hearted amusement. She felt tired
and depressed, and afraid of the position she
had undertaken to fill.</p>

<p>When she reached home she found that
Sadie and Marjorie had not yet come back
from school. She was anxious about their
delay, and stood on the doorstep looking up
the street to try and catch a sight of them.</p>

<p>“Why do you fret yourself about those two
children, bless your dear heart. They’re a
deal better able to look after themselves than
you are.”</p>

<p>One of the boarders was addressing Ada
from the hall.</p>

<p>“They’re so young to be out alone,” Ada
said. “They’ve always had someone to bring
and take them from school.”</p>

<p>“Time they learnt to come and go alone, I
guess. How long do you suppose you can go
on working yourself to pieces, anyhow? If
you want to do the best you can for these two
young ’uns, bring them up to look after themselves.
You were brought up like a sugar-plum,
and you’re feeling it mighty bad now, I
reckon, to be treated like pig-iron.”</p>

<p>“I know you mean kindly,” Ada said, “but
at least I have had the benefit of refined surroundings
in my youth. I can’t let little
Sadie knock about like a street child.”</p>

<p>“Much like a street child she is, with her
white starched petticoats, and dainty pinafores.
It’s just killing you, child, that’s what
it is, and coloured things are just as comfortable.”</p>

<p>“But we have only white things,” Ada said
apologetically, “and I’m afraid I can’t buy
any more just yet.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I never thought of that,”
the fat, good-natured boarder said laughingly.
“What’s going to happen to you, child, when
these fine things wear out. It does me good
to look at your pretty figure in these well-cut
gowns. But they won’t stand rough wear.”</p>

<p>Then Ada told her she was going to earn
fifteen dollars a week at Madame Maude’s.</p>

<p>“You’ll have all the young men in the town
coming to choose their sisters’ hats,” the
boarder said, “and men are a deal more easily
taken in than women folk. Madame Maude
is a clever woman.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THINGS_IN_SEASON_IN_MARKET_AND_KITCHEN">THINGS IN SEASON, IN MARKET AND KITCHEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3">OCTOBER.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> LA MÉNAGÈRE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Venison</span> and pork are the “novelties” that
we note in the markets this month, and also a
splendid show of brocoli. It is also a grand
time for cheeses, as many old-fashioned
country fairs testify. This month dairy
farmers will be busy bringing their cheeses
into the right markets ready for the Christmas
sales, and where cheeses are shown we usually
see sausages and pork pies, also gingerbread.
All these things are toothsome in October—the
month of mellow days and frosty nights.
We begin to get ready walnuts and chestnuts
for Hallowe’en festivities, and we sort out our
apples, some for cider, some for “biffins,”
and some for preserving. We must now
pickle our red cabbages, too, also onions, and
see that potatoes are stored. Those who
have good keeping places, even in town, may
now invest in sacks of potatoes, and bushels
of apples, as this is the time for getting these
at a cheaper rate than will be possible later
on. Housewives in the country who have
piggies to dispose of for bacon will be thinking
of turning the poor animals into that
useful commodity.</p>

<p>There is also the harvesting of the flower-seeds
and roots, and much work is done in
the flower garden preparatory for the next
spring. Indeed, this is altogether one of the
busiest months of all the year. Nature has
not yet gone to sleep, although she is preparing
for her winter’s rest.</p>

<p>We may now begin to bring into use some
of our dishes of heat-giving foods such as we
keep for winter days, not as a regular thing,
perhaps, but occasionally. For instance, we
may commence having porridge for breakfast,
warm puddings, good vegetable soups, honey
and treacle to our bread. Roast goose and
apple sauce will be a favourite dish with many
now, and, indeed, geese are better at this
time than later, as they are neither so rich nor
so fat.</p>

<p>So will also game pie be. Indeed, ever
since Friar Tuck feasted the disguised Cœur
de Lion upon this dish (which then was called
game pasty) in the heart of Sherwood Forest, it
has been a dish beloved of all Englishmen. Perhaps
it may not be amiss to give it here in detail.</p>

<p><i>Game Pie.</i>—A very good short or raised
crust is used to line the bottom and sides of
the mould. For the upper crust it is usual to
use puff pastry, although the raised crust is
quite good enough. Place first a layer of
small pieces of rump steak, then of venison
steaks, trimmed and rubbed with spice, salt
and pepper. Next some joints of hare, partridge,
or other game, and fill up all spaces
with highly-flavoured forcemeat. Add a little
gravy, and cover the dish closely, but not
with the crust; this should be put on when
the pie is rather more than half cooked.
Glaze this and ornament it when nearly
finished cooking.</p>

<p>A very good imitation of a game pie may
be made entirely without game, by using veal
and steak together, and adding plenty of well-made
forcemeat. As the gaminess will depend
on this forcemeat, it will be well to show
what this is composed of.</p>

<p>Half-a-pound of calf’s liver and as much
good ham should be baked in the oven in a
covered vessel until perfectly tender. Pound
these together in a mortar to a smooth paste.
Add a large tablespoonful of finely-powdered
herbs—thyme, marjoram, sage, savoury, and
tarragon—all these, or as many of them as
possible. Add also cayenne pepper, salt,
and a few chopped mushrooms. Mix very
thoroughly, and place little balls of this and
quarters of hard-boiled eggs at intervals with
the meat, then put in a little strong gravy,
place the top crust on, and bake the pie in a
baker’s oven until of a good deep brown.
When eaten cold this is uncommonly good.</p>

<p>A breakfast dish met with in Yorkshire,
but not, I believe, elsewhere, is a <i>Covered
Apple Tart</i>, and very good it is, either hot or
cold. The crust would be ordinary short or
flaky paste rolled out to about a quarter of
an inch thick. On the lower crust a thick
layer of stewed, sweetened, and spiced apple
is placed, the top crust put on, the edges
crimped together, and melted butter brushed
over all, then well baked.</p>

<p>Hominy cakes with honey, and oatmeal
batter-cakes, are delicious for breakfast also.</p>

<p>We should not omit also to have plenty of
roasted apples at all times while they are so
good, and the smaller pears and apples will be
very good eating indeed if they are baked in a
stone jar in a baker’s oven.</p>

<p>A good dinner menu for October would be
the following:—</p>

<p class="center">
Potato Soup, with Grated Cheese.<br />
Gurnet, Baked and Stuffed.<br />
Roast Loin of Pork. Apple Sauce.<br />
Brocoli and Baked Potatoes.<br />
Wild Duck. Orange Salad. Cranberry Jelly.<br />
Cabinet Pudding.<br />
Cheese. Biscuits. Butter.<br />
</p>

<p><i>Potato Soup.</i>—Peel, boil and mash half-a-dozen
potatoes, and slice up a small Spanish
onion into a little butter, which should cook
while the potatoes are boiling. Put all together,
and add a pint of boiling milk, a
spoonful of flour mixed smooth with milk,
and boil together. Season with pepper and
salt, and if not already too thick add a little
cream. Serve very hot with grated cheese in
a separate dish.</p>

<p>The <i>Gurnet</i> are stuffed with a mixture of
chopped shallot, parsley, herbs, breadcrumbs,
butter, seasoning, and an egg. Grate breadcrumbs
over, and pour on them a little oiled
butter, and bake in a fairly quick oven for
about twenty minutes or half an hour. Serve
in the same dish if it is a nice one.</p>

<p><i>Wild Duck</i> require very quick roasting and
frequent basting. Garnish them with a lemon
cut in quarters, and serve any gravy that may
have run from them in a tureen.</p>

<p><i>Orange Salad</i> is made by slicing peeled
oranges, freeing them from pips, and covering
the slices with a little sugar.</p>

<p><i>Cabinet Pudding.</i>—Put a pint of new milk
on to boil with two spoonfuls of sugar and the
rind of a fresh lemon; then add it to three
well-beaten eggs. Butter a mould, and
decorate the bottom and sides with strips of
candied peel, stoned raisins, etc. Fill with
alternate layers of sliced sponge cake and
raisins. Pour the custard over, and let it soak
for an hour or so, then cover with buttered
paper, and steam the pudding gently for an
hour and a half.</p>

<p>If this pudding were for eating cold (and it
is quite as good so), a little dissolved gelatine
should be added to the custard before pouring
it over the cake. A few macaroons give a nice
flavour to a cold pudding.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_ROMANTICISM_OF_BEETHOVEN">THE ROMANTICISM OF BEETHOVEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> ELEONORE D’ESTERRE-KEELING.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> title of this paper will probably surprise
many of my readers who have been accustomed
to regard Beethoven solely as the king
of classic music.</p>

<p>I have not set myself so foolish a task as
the attempt to prove that this is not his true
position. Undoubtedly Beethoven is king of
classic music, but—how much more than that
he is!</p>

<p>It must have struck everyone that there is a
certain quality in Beethoven’s music which is
absent from that of every other classic composer,
a quality which appeals to each one of
us personally, and which does not appeal in
vain.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp46" id="i792" style="max-width: 21.875em;">

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">THE HOUSE WHERE BEETHOVEN WAS BORN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>If we play consecutively three or four
Sonates by Haydn or by Mozart, what is
almost invariably the result?</p>

<p>In each case we like the first one and
probably the second one; at the third we
begin to feel bored, and at the fourth we shut
up the book. And yet how lovely they all
are! Haydn takes us to play with the
children; Mozart introduces us to the ballroom.
But Haydn did not spend his life’s
days on a merry-go-round, and Mozart was
not perpetually paying compliments. Quite
the contrary. Haydn, as we know, never had
any children, and that disagreeable wife of
his left little happiness for his home. As
for Mozart—well, Mozart had a charming
wife, but he was so pitifully poor that one
winter’s morning, when the snow lay thick on
the ground outside, a friendly neighbour,
calling in to see how the young couple were
getting on, found them dancing a waltz on
the bare boards of their scantily furnished
room. They had no fire, and this was the
only means that they could devise for keeping
themselves warm.</p>

<p>When Mozart went on a journey, he wrote
the prettiest love-letters to his Stanzerl.
Here is a bit of one of them:—“Dear little
wife! If I only had a letter from you! If I
were to tell you all that I do with your dear
likeness, how you would laugh! For instance,
when I take it out of its case, I say ‘God
greet thee, Stanzerl, God greet thee, thou
rascal, shuttlecock, pointy-nose, nick-nack,
bit and sup!’ And when I put it back, I let
it slip in very slowly, saying, with each little
push, ‘Now—now—now!’ and at the last,
quickly—‘Good night, little mouse, sleep
well!’” There is nothing in all Mozart’s
music the least little bit like that. And
why?</p>

<p>Mozart’s music is strictly classical and
anti-romantic. His character is stamped upon
it, as the character of Haydn is stamped upon
his music, but his circumstances, the events of
his daily life, have no part in it, and whether
he had been rich or poor, successful or
despairing, his music would have been exactly
the same.</p>

<p>With Beethoven quite the reverse is the
case. If it were possible to play the whole
volume of Beethoven’s Sonates at one sitting,
the last thing player or listener could complain
of would be the monotony which culminates
in boredom.</p>

<p>There would be Beethoven tender, Beethoven
sublime, Beethoven ferocious, Beethoven
serene, and as many more Beethovens as
there are adjectives in the dictionary. And
this is the secret of Beethoven’s popularity.</p>

<p>For the musician there is the perfect form,
the exquisite mode of expression; for the
amateur there is the man, with all the hopes
and fears and aspirations which he shares with
his fellow man.</p>

<p>Beethoven wrote the most meagre of letters,
but every emotion that swayed him found
utterance in his music, and this it is which
gives to his music the quality known as
Romanticism.</p>

<p>Many definitions have been given of the
terms classical and romantic, but the clearest
and cleverest definition that I have met is
that given by the French writer, Monsieur
Brunetière,—“Classicism makes the impersonality
of a work of art one of the conditions
of its perfection, while Romanticism means
Individualism.” In other words, classicism
confines itself to the thing done; romanticism
is more interested in the doer of that thing.</p>

<p>Beethoven’s earliest works in each branch
of his art are purely classical. During their
composition he was leaning on Haydn and
Mozart. Life had not yet become to him a
matter of absorbing interest, for he still
regarded it from the standpoint of the
student.</p>

<p>The Fantasie Sonate, Op. 27, No. 2
(ignorantly called the “Moonlight Sonata”),
opens to us the first page of the tone-poet’s
life. It was written in 1801, when Beethoven
was thirty-one.</p>

<p>Thirty-one! At this age a man feels life at
its best; it is then that his pulse beats strongest,
that, his powers being fully developed,
he sees the years stretch smiling before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_793"></a>{793}</span>
him, like the vision of a promised land. All
this Beethoven felt, and he was fully
conscious of his power. “The Eroica,” the
great ‘C Minor,’ “The Choral Symphony,”
“Fidelio,” locked within that mighty brain,
awaited only the master’s bidding to come
forth and delight a world.</p>

<p>But between him and this glorious future
there fell a shadow which was destined to rob
life of all that made life dear. He plainly
saw that shadow.</p>

<p>In a letter to a friend, written at this time,
he says, “How sadly must I live! All that I
love I must avoid. The years will pass
without bringing that which my talent and
my art had promised. Mournful resignation,
in which alone I can find refuge!”</p>

<p>Already the gates of his ears were closing,
and deafness was shutting him out from the
world which he had just begun to love.</p>

<p>Then he met the beautiful Countess Julie
Guicciardi. She was sixteen, she was poor,
and he gave her music lessons without payment,
accepting only in return
linen which her pretty
fingers had stitched.</p>

<p>She was flattered by his
homage (what girl would not
be flattered by the homage
of a Beethoven!) and she encouraged
his attentions. Perhaps
even she really loved
him.</p>

<p>Again he wrote to a friend:
“Somewhat more agreeably
I live now, going more among
people. This change has been
wrought by a dear, bewitching
girl, who loves me and whom
I love. At last after two
years’ misery, some happy
moments have come, and I
feel for the first time that
marriage could make me
happy.”</p>

<p>Poor Beethoven! Countess
Julie’s father had other
plans for his young daughter,
and her music master was
scornfully dismissed.</p>

<p>The mental conflict of this
period found expression in the
“Fantasie Sonate.” The
mournful resignation of the
first movement contrasts
vividly with the thunder of
the finale.</p>

<p>In a letter to his friend
Wegeler, Beethoven now
wrote:—“If nothing else is
possible I will defy my fate,
though moments will always
come in which I shall be the
wretchedest of men.”</p>

<p>He spoke so much more
eloquently in music than he
did in words, that I should
like to take my readers to
the piano and tell his story
there. But let us beware of
playing the Sonate <i>romantically</i>.
In interpreting an
emotional work this is a danger
which must always be carefully
avoided. We should
not repeat the poet’s story as
it affects us, but as it affected
him.</p>

<p>The resignation of the first
movement must be the resignation
of a strong nature—there
is fire beneath it. A
Beethoven does not shed
tears.</p>

<p>In the second movement
the poet conjures up before
his mind the memory of
happy hours, gone for ever. His child-love
appears before him in all her grace and
witchery. There must be something phantom-like
about it, something very tender, almost
intangible.</p>

<p>The last movement is a song of anguish
and despair. The proud spirit “defies its
fate,” but there are moments in which we
recognise “the wretchedest of men.”</p>

<p>Thus ended Beethoven’s first love-story.
There was no tender parting between him and
Julie; the “Fantasie-Sonate,” dedicated to
her, was his last love-letter, and with it he
dismissed her from his mind. “Strength,”
he said proudly, “is the characteristic of men
who distinguish themselves above others, and
it is mine!” It was his.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">BEETHOVEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>All Europe was now ringing with the fame
of Napoleon, the only person on earth—except
Goethe—whom Beethoven regarded as
his equal, while of him, even, he said, when,
in 1806, news of Napoleon’s victory at Jena
was brought, “What a pity that I don’t
understand war as I understand music. <i>I</i>
would conquer him!”</p>

<p>In this mood the Eroica Symphony was
written. It is a chapter of history.</p>

<p>But I have not space to follow the great
Romanticist through all his moods and their
outpourings. I must confine myself to a few
of them.</p>

<p>In October 1802 Beethoven was sent by his
doctors to Heiligenstadt, a quiet village not
far from Vienna. He was in a state of the
deepest despondency. The shadows were
closing round him, and the voices of the world
reached him but faintly.</p>

<p>In the stillness of the country he found
peace, the exquisite Sonate in D minor,
op. 31, no. 2, was written there. Let us
take it to the piano too, and listen to its
tragic story.</p>

<p>The long drawn out arpeggios with which
it opens are the longings of his heart. (He
was still only thirty-two!) Joy dances fantastically
round him and vanishes. Another sigh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_794"></a>{794}</span>
another vision of joy, and then heaven opens
and he looks in.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp68" id="i794a" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_794a.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">COUNTESS THERESE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>I do not think that even Beethoven ever
wrote anything more wonderful, more full of
the ecstasy of being, than that glorious first
movement.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="i794b" style="max-width: 34.375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_794b.jpg"  alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="center">ROOM IN BEETHOVEN’S HOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The second part of the Sonate is very slow,
and at first it seems to promise peace for the
troubled soul. It is in B flat major, which
should and does suggest rest. But after such
a struggle as the first movement indicated,
peace does not come at once; listen to the
throbbing, shuddering triplets in the bass; they
begin at the seventeenth bar, and every time
that they occur they are followed by a lament
in the minor. They accompany that lament.
Further on, we find a lovely song-like passage
in F major (bar 31), and now see how beautifully
Beethoven arrives at that song. Laying
a gentle hand on his triplets (bar 27) he
smoothes them into even notes, changes the
sad C minor for C major, and then brings in
his song. But that song is only a rift in the
clouds; the storm comes on again, always
heralded by the triplets, and note the curious
accompaniment given later on to the left
hand. Right up at the top of the key-board
it begins and slowly it creeps down, always
down. Hope would ascend—that passage
marks despair. Once again comes the song
of comfort, this time in B flat major, and the
movement closes calmly in the same key.</p>

<p>The last part of the Sonate had a curious
origin. Seated in his silent room, which
looked out upon the little-frequented high road
leading to the village, the composer became
conscious of the trab-trab of a horse whose
rider was passing by. The rhythmic movements
of the animal’s hoofs, heard as they
were but faintly by the half deaf musician,
resolved themselves into a phrase in his mind
which he jotted down mechanically, and this
phrase persistently reiterated, formed the conclusion
to the Sonate which was then filling
heart and brain.</p>

<p>Only Beethoven would have conceived
psychology so good as that. How often in
the most crucial moments some trifling,
quite irrelevant detail forces itself upon our
notice, and absorbs attention which we should
be unwilling to acknowledge.</p>

<p>The portrait of the great composer’s soul,
which he painted for us in the D minor Sonate,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_796"></a>{796}</span>
would have been less perfect had he withheld
the trivial circumstance which awoke him
from his dreams, and gave him again to the
world.</p>

<p>At this country retreat the famous Heiligenstadt
will was also written.</p>

<p>It shows us another side of Beethoven’s
character, and leads to another phase of his
Romanticism.</p>

<p>The will begins thus: “Oh, you men, you
who have thought of me as defiant, stubborn,
misanthropic, what wrong you have done me!
Bethink you that for six years an incurable
condition has befallen me, made worse by
foolish doctors who from year to year deceived
me with hopes of improvement. Though
born with a fiery temperament, and even susceptible
to the charms of society, I have had
to separate myself from everyone, and pass
my years in loneliness.</p>

<p>“What mortification when someone, standing
beside me, caught from afar the sound of
a flute and I heard nothing!</p>

<p>“Such incidents brought me to the verge of
madness, and little more was wanted to make
me put an end to my existence.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">RELICS OF BEETHOVEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>“Only my art held me back. Ah, I felt
that it was impossible to leave the world
before I had accomplished my mission!</p>

<p>“Great God, Thou who lookest down upon
me, Thou seest my heart and Thou knowest
that love and goodwill abide there.”</p>

<p>Immediately after this will, the six sacred
songs, to words by Gellert (op. 48), were
composed.</p>

<p>There is something infinitely pathetic in
the thought of this great, lonely man, so profoundly
ashamed of his bodily infirmity, and
so conscious that he was misunderstood by all
his fellow-men, turning thus in the hour of his
sorest need to the One whom he could trust.
The first of the six songs is a Prayer, the last
a Song of Repentance. They are all very
simple, as such songs should be, and through
them the strong, personal note is unmistakable.</p>

<p>The quiet life at Heiligenstadt had another
beneficial effect upon Beethoven. Both the
Pastoral Symphony and the Pastoral Sonate
trace the source of their inspiration to the
pine forests, the rustic surroundings and
Sabbath stillness of this picturesque village.
The Symphony of
course was a later
work, but it was
also composed at
this, Beethoven’s
favourite holiday
resort.</p>

<p>But ardent
lover of Nature
though he was,
he was not the
sort of man who
could pass his
days in sylvan
solitude. He was
extremely sociable,
even, in his
way, extremely
domestic.</p>

<p>Probably if he
had secured the
happy home life
for which he so
often longed, we
should have been the losers, for he might
truly have said, with Heine—</p>

<p>“Out of my great sorrows I make the little
songs.”</p>

<p>When he made his will at Heiligenstadt he
believed himself to be dying. At the close of
it came this prayer—</p>

<p>“O Providence, let once a day of pure
happiness shine upon me!”</p>

<p>That prayer was granted, and he found
many days of pure happiness by the side of
the Countess Therese of Brunswick, the aunt
of the faithless Julie.</p>

<p>Countess Therese was the right woman for
him, and nobody knows why their marriage
did not take place. They were certainly
betrothed, and Therese’s brother Franz was
Beethoven’s most intimate friend. To him
the Sonate Appassionata was dedicated, surely
the grandest tribute that could be paid to any
friendship. It was written during the composer’s
visit to the Brunswicks’ estate in
Hungary in the summer of 1806, and probably
was intended as a message for Therese, which
her lover could not trust himself to deliver.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving the Brunswicks Beethoven
wrote to the Count—</p>

<p>“Dear, dear Franz! Only a line to tell you
that I have made good terms with Clementi.
Two hundred pounds I am to get, and over
and above I can sell the same works again in
Germany and France. Further, he has given
me other orders, so that I may reasonably
hope to attain the dignity of a true artist in
early years. Kiss thy sister Therese, and tell
her that I am afraid I shall become famous
before she has erected a monument to me.”</p>

<p>At the same time, July, 1806, the much-discussed
love-letter was written. This letter
was found, after his death, among Beethoven’s
papers, with the portrait of the Countess
Therese, which is reproduced in this number
of <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span>. The original is
an oil-painting, and on the back of it is written
(in German of course):—</p>

<p>“To the rare genius, the great artist, the
good man, from T. B.”</p>

<p>Every biographer of Beethoven has had a
different theory as to the love-letter, but it is
now generally granted that it must have been
addressed to the Countess Therese, whom
Beethoven in it calls “<i>meine unsterbliche Geliebte</i>.”
(My immortal love). The letter
begins:<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> “<i>Mein Leben, mein Alles, mein ich</i>”
(My life, my all, my self), and the exquisite
Sonate in F sharp, op. 78, which is
so seldom played, translates those
words into music. This Sonate was
written in the autumn of 1809, when
Beethoven was again with the Brunswicks
in Hungary, and it is dedicated
to the Countess Therese.</p>

<p>Rather an amusing incident in
connection with it is related in a
conversation between Beethoven and
his pupil Czerny, at the end of which
the composer exclaimed irritably—</p>

<p>“People always talk of the C sharp
minor Sonate as if I hadn’t composed
much better things. The F sharp
Sonate is something very different!”</p>

<p>The C sharp minor Sonate was Julie
Guicciardi’s, and it did not please
Therese Brunswick’s lover to be reminded
so often of that old love-story.</p>

<p>But he was quite right. The F
sharp Sonate undoubtedly is a very
different thing. It is less passionate,
but it is much more finished. There
is a sweet serenity about it which
suits the noble face of the gracious
lady who inspired it. My readers
will need no guidance through it;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_797"></a>{797}</span>
one glance at Therese’s portrait will help them
more than anything I could say. “Mein
Leben, mein Alles, mein besseres ich” sings
the little prelude, and then the piece glides
along like a boat on a sunny sea. Lucky
Beethoven and lucky Therese, the day of pure
happiness has come!</p>

<p>There is one more phase of Beethoven’s
character upon which I want briefly to touch.
Everyone knows that during his last years he
was often in great straits for want of money.
Perhaps you, my readers, will not think that
money troubles are a feature of Romanticism,
but money troubles, like others, may be the
cause of anxiety, heart-burning or disappointment,
and when these feelings are expressed
in any work, the personal element, with them
introduced, is the source of Romanticism.</p>

<p>Amongst Beethoven’s MSS. there was
found after his death a Rondo inscribed in
his own handwriting—</p>

<p>“The rage over a lost penny, worked off in
a Rondo.”</p>

<p>That Rondo is one of the prettiest and the
wittiest things in music.</p>

<p>The average Englishman will scarcely be
able to realise that a man like Beethoven, a
genius, could make such a fuss over a lost
penny, but those who know Germans will be
less incredulous.</p>

<p>Perhaps, too, it was not just the penny; it
may have been the principle!</p>

<p>At all times Beethoven was suspicious, and he
always thought that he was being cheated. He
very often was cheated, and when we remember
that by this time he was stone-deaf, and that
he had no sympathetic friend to whom he
could confide his troubles, we shall begin to
understand why he put his rage over a lost
penny into his music, with all his other
emotions.</p>

<p>The piece (op. 129) is not easy to play, for
it requires a reckless self-abandonment which
is only possible to those players to whom
it offers no technical difficulties. Bülow’s
edition of it, published by Cotta, is the best.
In one of his notes the editor says, “You can
see the papers fly from the table, while the
furious hunt proceeds,” and he declares that
the man who wrote this brilliant Rondo
could have written an <i>opera bouffe</i> if he had
tried.</p>

<p>Much more might be said about Beethoven’s
Romanticism. I have not touched at all
upon his more exalted phases of feeling, the
patriotism which was so wonderfully expressed
in the seventh Symphony, the philosophy of
life which culminated in the Choral Symphony
with its impossible “Ode to Joy,” telling in
tones what Goethe tried to tell in words at
the end of the second part of <i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p>My object had been to show that musical
form, or perfect classicism, was the beautiful
vessel which Beethoven made use of to carry
his own human thoughts and emotions, and
that, as Maurice Hewlett says in his book,
<i>Pan and the Young Shepherd</i>—</p>

<p>“Life goes to a tune, according as a man
is tuneful, hath music.”</p>

<p class="ph3">A STORY FOR GIRLS</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> EVELYN EVERETT-GREEN, Author of “Greyfriars,” “Half-a-Dozen Sisters,” etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER XXIII.</h3>

<p class="ph3">SUNSHINE.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a balmy day at the end of April,
and in the great conservatory at
Monckton Manor a little group of people
had established themselves amongst the
tall ferns and flowers, and girlish voices
and laughter mingled with the plash of
the fountain in the centre of the warm
fragrant place.</p>

<p>Upon a cane lounge lay Oscar, white
and thin, and frail of aspect, yet with
something of the vigour and animation
of returning health, which was very
visible to those who had watched
tremblingly beside him during the weeks
of his tedious illness.</p>

<p>Sheila and May Lawrence sat near
him, chatting with the ease and familiarity
of an intimate friendship. It had
long been May’s most cherished plan
that so soon as Oscar should be strong
enough for the move, he should be
transported to Monckton Manor; and
her mother had fallen in with the idea
so soon as she had been assured on
medical testimony that there was no fear
of his bringing infection into the house.</p>

<p>So a fortnight ago the move had been
made, and out in the pure fresh air of
the country, away from the noise and
bustle of the streets and a busy household,
Oscar had made a fresh start, and
had surprised everybody by the rapidity
with which he gained ground.</p>

<p>For a week past he had almost lived
in the conservatory, which, with its
evenly regulated atmosphere, its sweet
flower scents and the sensation of airiness
and freshness, was almost like a
new world to the invalid. He felt as
though he were living out of doors “in
Madeira,” as he would smilingly say;
and then he and May would get Sheila
to tell of beautiful Madeira, its rainbows,
its flowers, its sunshine and long cloudless
days; and Oscar would lie listening
and dreaming, till he felt as though he
were living the life there himself.</p>

<p>And Sheila, talking with absolute
freedom to the brother with whom she
had always shared her thoughts, and
from whom she had never kept a secret,
and to the girl-friend whom she now felt
as though she had always known, soon
talked away every bit of bitterness or
vexation, and would enjoy a hearty laugh
with her companions over the little
weaknesses of her aunt, and think
instead of her devotion to her daughter,
which had led her into some comical
errors. Since Sheila had learned to
forget herself, to lose the sense of her
own little wrongs, to feel everything
merged in the great ocean of the
unchangeable love which had wrapped
her round in the hour of her keenest
need, and had given her back her
brother from the very gates of the grave,
it had been so easy to forgive and forget.
All the bitterness had been washed
away. She was ashamed to think how
angry she once had been. Everything
else had looked so small, so insignificant,
when seen in the light of the solemn
realities of life. And although now the
graver mood had passed, and with a
rebound of nature, Sheila was her own
bright laughing self again, yet there
was a new sweetness in her smile, and
new softness in her manner, and Oscar
would lie and look at her in a great
content, wondering what the change
was and whence it had come.</p>

<p>“Here is North!” cried Sheila,
suddenly springing up to get a better
view through the palm leaves, whilst a
bright flush suddenly rose in May’s
cheeks, and the light leaped into her
eyes. “I suppose he has come to see
Oscar; really he is wonderfully attentive
just now. He comes very often.”</p>

<p>May’s eyes were dancing, as she
looked eagerly towards the advancing
figure; and though his errand was
ostensibly to ask for the invalid, it was
to her face that his eyes first leapt as he
made his way towards them.</p>

<p>Oscar had no need to expatiate upon
his progress, his face spoke for him, and
North looked satisfied and pleased.</p>

<p>“My father wants to see you, Oscar,
when you are a little stronger. He has
several things to say to you. That bit
of mystery about the bill has all been
cleared up. He wants to speak of it to
you once, and then bury the miserable
business in oblivion.”</p>

<p>Oscar’s colour came and went. Sheila
clasped her hands together in excitement,
and May’s flush deepened in her cheeks
as she asked softly—</p>

<p>“Shall I go away whilst you talk it
over?”</p>

<p>But North shook his head.</p>

<p>“There is no need for that, I think.
You are Sheila’s friend, and I expect you
know all that we have done for some
while. Of course, it is very painful for
us, but the truth must not be ignored.
Suspicion cannot be permitted to attach
to Oscar. Even though Cyril is my
father’s son, he must not be screened
at the expense of another.”</p>

<p>“I am so sorry!” breathed May
softly.</p>

<p>“Yes; it has been a heavy blow to
both my father and mother. The chief
hope is, that having had his eyes
thoroughly opened, my father may see
that a different method must be pursued
with Cyril. Temptation has come to
him through opportunity. If the
conditions are changed, things may be
better, for he is, I trust, sincerely
ashamed and repentant at last. It has
been a miserable business looking into
his affairs this past year, but we have
got to the bottom of things now, and I
feel sure his eyes have been thoroughly
opened, and our mother’s grief has
touched his heart. I hope this is the
end of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so—I do hope so!”
breathed Sheila softly.</p>

<p>“And I was still to blame,” said
Oscar. “I ought never to have let the
money out of my hands.”</p>

<p>“Well, so I say,” answered North,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_798"></a>{798}</span>
with a smile, “but my father exonerates
you even there. He says that he would
not have hesitated to place it in Cyril’s
hands himself, and would have taken a
receipt from him without scrutiny; and
he cannot blame you for what he would
have done himself without a thought.
However, that can rest now. What my
father wishes is to come and see you,
afterwards to briefly explain the matter in
the office to those who know the circumstances,
during Cyril’s absence, and
then to try and forget the whole business
and speak of it no more.”</p>

<p>“Is Cyril going away?” asked Sheila
quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes, for a time; and to Madeira
first. Our uncle has just written, inviting
him rather pressingly. It seems that
he has been rather bitten by the tales of
travel he has heard from the visitors
there, and he wants to see a little more
of the world before returning home.
Aunt Cossart and Effie do not share
this desire, and they will shortly come
home together in the mail; but he wants
to go to the Canary Islands, and then
take a boat for the Mediterranean, and
see some of the African ports, and Spain
and perhaps something of Italy, before
he gets back; and he wants Cyril for
his travelling companion.”</p>

<p>“Fancy Uncle Cossart turning into
a globe-trotter!” cried Sheila merrily.
“But how nice for Cyril!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it seems just the thing for the
time being. He will be better away for
a little while, and we shall know that he
is in safe keeping. My father will write
a full account of everything to our uncle—that
is only right. But he has always
been a favourite with them, and they
will be glad to help us out of a present
difficulty by taking him off, away from
his old companions, and giving him
something to do in playing courier to
Uncle Cossart. Cyril is a good traveller
and speaks several languages with a fair
fluency. He is as much pleased with
the prospect as he could be with
anything in his present frame of mind.”</p>

<p>“And are Aunt Cossart and Effie
coming home?” asked Sheila with
interest.</p>

<p>“Yes, by the next mail after Cyril
arrives there. Effie is so much better
that there is no need to keep her out any
longer, and our aunt is beginning to tire
of hotel life, and to want to get back to
her own home again. She wants you
and Oscar to be there to welcome them,
Sheila; and invites Oscar for the whole
summer. She thinks he would be much
better a little way out of the town after
his illness, even when he is well and at
the office again; and she says that the
dog-cart or a riding horse will always be
at his disposal to take him backwards
and forwards.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind of her!” cried Oscar,
with a look of animation and pleasure in
his face; and Sheila felt her own cheeks
growing hot. She remembered her angry
words of a few months back—“I will
never forgive Aunt Cossart. I will
never, never live at Cossart Place
again!”—and a wave of self-reproach
and humility swept over her, as she
realised how hasty she had been in
judging and condemning.</p>

<p>Her aunt might not always be very
wise, or even quite just; but she was
very kind of heart. If her fondness for
her daughter made her foolish sometimes,
she could show at others a very
tender consideration and thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>“It would be splendid for Oscar,” she
said softly; “I should like to send a
letter to Aunt Cossart by Cyril. I’m
afraid I have not always been quite nice
to her and Effie; but I will try to be
better now.”</p>

<p>Oscar flashed a look at her that
brought sudden tears to her eyes, and
May, seeming to divine that they wanted
to talk to each other, suggested that
North should come and see the daffodils
in the copse; they were looking so
lovely in this flood of spring sunshine.</p>

<p>“Oh, Oscar,” cried Sheila, as soon
as they were alone, “I do feel so
ashamed!”</p>

<p>He knew what she meant, and
answered smiling—</p>

<p>“Well, you know, it was rather hard
lines on you after all; and you only let
fly to me. Nobody else knows; and you
tell me you said hardly anything to Aunt
Cossart before leaving.”</p>

<p>“No, I was too angry, too miserable.
I knew if I talked I should cry. But,
oh, how furious I was with her in my
heart!”</p>

<p>“That was bad; but we all have our
falls. You have not been furious now
for a long while; and I hope you will
not be tempted again.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not—I hope I know
better. But, Oscar, if it had not been
for your being ill directly, and everything
else going out of my head, I should have
talked to Ray and everybody as I did to
you. My head was full of the things I
meant to say; and how I never, never,
never would go to Cossart Place, or be
with Effie, or do anything they wanted
me to any more! Think if I had had it
all out to them; and then this kind letter
from Aunt Cossart, thinking of such a
splendid plan for you! Oh, how
miserable and ashamed I should have
been. I am rather now; but it would
have been ten times worse then!”</p>

<p>“Yes; so I suppose we had better try
and learn to keep our hot angry thoughts
to ourselves,” said Oscar thoughtfully,
“and fight them down, and see what
they are really like before we try and let
fly! Looking back at things, I’ve often
been sorry for speaking hastily; but I
don’t think I’ve ever been sorry for
holding my tongue, when it would have
been rather a satisfaction to let it run
away with me!”</p>

<p>“My tongue was always a more unruly
member than yours, Oscar,” said Sheila
with a smile and a sigh, “but I will try
to keep it more under control; and, oh, it
will not be difficult when we are together.
We shall have such lovely times up there.
It really is a nice place; only it was dull
before. But if you are there every
evening, it will always be something to
look forward to. And oh, Oscar, isn’t
it good that you are cleared! I had
almost forgotten that—because I think
in the end nobody at home believed it
of you. But I am so glad uncle knows
everything; though how could Cyril do
it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he was very much tempted.
I am afraid he got into bad company
and was in great straits lest exposure
should follow. It is easy for us who are
not tempted in that way to be very much
horrified; but we have our own falls into
our besetting sins. That should make
us very careful how we judge other
people. Should we do better in like
case?”</p>

<p>Sheila was silent and thoughtful; she
could not believe for a moment that her
brother could ever fall into such a
transgression; but it came to her that
probably Cyril had not fallen all at once,
but had given way little by little to
what seemed like venial sins, till at last
it had been easy to commit one from
which at the outset he would have shrunk
in horror.</p>

<p>“Whosoever hateth his brother is a
murderer!” The words seemed to be
spoken in her ear; and she realised
with a start of shame and horror her
own spasms of bitter hatred. If she had
given way to her impulses of anger, if
she had blindly followed her own
impulsive thoughts and purposes, what
family breach might not have taken
place—what bitterness might not have
been aroused? In her heart—in the
sight of God—she might have been a
murderer!</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands, and
was silent; and Oscar, who was also
very thoughtful, spoke no word. He was
thinking himself to what proportions his
own carelessness and shiftlessness might
have grown, had it not been that the
sharp lesson met with had pulled him up
short.</p>

<p>It seemed long before the other pair
rejoined them; and then North had
only time to say a hasty farewell and
walk off to the works again. He had
stolen an opportunity when things were
a little slack to make his visit; but he
wished to be back before closing time.</p>

<p>“Oscar must have his beef-tea and a
nap,” May decreed with an air of
sovereignty which became her well.
“Ah, and here it comes. And then you
and I will take a stroll together, Sheila.
It is so lovely out of doors!”</p>

<p>The excitement of North’s visit had
disposed Oscar for a rest now that it
was over, and he settled himself contentedly
after he had taken his kitchen
physic. The two girls left him to
sleep, and passed out into the sunshine
together.</p>

<p>Sheila talked eagerly of the future
and her delight in having Oscar with her
for the summer. May assented cordially
and gladly; but went off into a brown
study afterwards, giving her answers at
random. At last Sheila stopped short
laughing and looked at her. Something
in her face bespoke such a vivid happiness
that she was half startled.</p>

<p>“May, what is it? What has
happened?” she asked; and the smile
which broke over May’s face was
brighter than the sunshine itself.</p>

<p>“That is what I want to tell you.
That is what I got you out here for. I
am the happiest girl in all the world.
North has told me that he loves me.
He has asked me to be his wife!”</p>

playing with my dolls, I always took the part
of servant, and, as I have grown older, every

therefore do wisely to follow her natural bent.
The important question a girl should ask
herself in choosing a career is “What is the
best class of work that I am likely to be able
to do successfully?” For instance, there are
conceivable cases in which a girl might feel
that she would make a good dressmaker or a
good painter; we should then consider that,
if no difficulties presented themselves on the
pecuniary side, the painter’s profession should
be chosen. Girls nowadays often fall into
one of two errors; either they try to do
work which stands highest in human esteem
and fail because they have not the power to
do it, or, from reasons of over-modesty or
indolence, they choose to perform mechanical
and subordinate work, when with a little
effort and determination they could rise to
something better. But among girls of the
middle class the first mistake, the mistake of
over-ambition is the more usual. To return
to the practical problem set us by our
correspondent, we think there is every
argument in favour of “Catherine Nancy’s”
entering domestic service. Formerly no doubt
there might have been an objection that
“Catherine Nancy” would be cut off from
association with friends of her own class; but
this difficulty is rapidly disappearing.
“Catherine Nancy” may like to be informed
that “lady servants” are now in great demand,
and that employers are often willing to make
important concessions in order to obtain them.
Many persons employ only ladies in their
service, while others are often willing to give
training to a well-educated girl in return for
services. “Catherine Nancy” could very
probably be received into some clergyman’s or
other nice household on the footing we have
mentioned. It may be worth while to remind
“Catherine Nancy” that it might be desirable
later to rise from the position of housemaid to
that of parlourmaid. The duties of a parlourmaid,
comprising as they do the showing-in of
visitors, waiting at table and polishing the
plate and glass, are peculiarly suitable for a
ladylike girl to perform. But it would be
time enough later to consider the advisability
of such a change as this, and in any case it
would be well to begin as a housemaid. We
recommend “Catherine Nancy” to advertise
for a situation as housemaid in a house where
lady-servants are employed.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Laundry Work.</span>—“<i>Is there any place
where I could obtain lessons in laundry work?
I need to earn some money, and I think I could
obtain the washing for one family; but though
I wash well, I do not think I am a sufficiently
good ironer at present.</i>—C. M.”</p>

<p>“C. M.” could be well taught in the Battersea,
Borough Road, or Regent Street,
Polytechnic. The last would be most convenient
for her in point of locality, but by
inquiry at some Board School in her neighbourhood
she might hear of evening classes
being held still nearer to her home. This would
be decidedly advantageous, as omnibus fares
from north-west London, where she lives,
would cost money, which we are sure from
her letter she could ill afford to spend. For
some reasons we should have thought it better
for “C. M.” to take employment in some large
steam laundry until she has learnt all departments
of the work thoroughly, for she is
doubtless reluctant to leave home for many
hours at a time. May we express to “C. M.”
our admiration for the thrift displayed in
the little account she gives us of her
expenditure. There are not many couples
who would attempt to spare out of 22s. a
week, 2s. 6d. for insurance and sick pay, and
2s. for an aged relative. But we cannot doubt
that people who enter on married life in this
spirit, determined to be both thrifty and
generous, will not want for means or help
in days to come.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Dressmaking Question.</span>—“<i>I wish to
place a lady, aged twenty-one, in some business
or profession to enable her to earn a living. She
leans to dressmaking. Do you recommend
that trade? How long will it take to learn it
in all its branches? What premium will
have to be paid by an outdoor apprentice?
Presuming that she studies for two years,
what ought she to be able to earn at the end of
that time? What would be the hours of work
of an apprentice who paid a premium? Can
you recommend a firm of dressmakers in
Brighton who teach?</i>—<span class="smcap">Stoke.</span>”</p>

<p>To anyone with a taste for dressmaking we
undoubtedly recommend the business. We
receive intimations continually of good
openings for women to establish themselves as
dressmakers. We will reply to “Stoke’s”
numerous questions in their order. In two
years a girl ought to be able to obtain a fair
all-round knowledge of dressmaking; but she
must be careful to insist on being taught the
work of each department, as in some firms
there is a tendency to keep a girl at one kind
of work only. An outdoor apprentice is not
usually asked to pay a premium, but is expected
to give services for some little time. The
length of this period of free service varies
greatly, as much according to the custom of
the firm as the ability of the young dressmaker.
In any case the outdoor apprentice is not
likely to receive more than a shilling or two a
week during any portion of the first year.
What she would receive at the end of two
years is most difficult to foretell, so much
depending on the amount of aptitude she had
developed in the meantime. The average
wages of employees in London dressmaking
businesses are, resident fitters, £40 to £100
a year; experienced bodice-hands, 16s. to
20s. a week; ordinary bodice-hands, 12s. to
15s. a week; assistants, 8s. to 10s.; skirt-hands,
8s. to 18s. It is probable that she
would have to begin as an improver at 8s. A
fashionable and well-paying firm in the West
End that is known to us pays its out-workers
11s. to 18s. a week. The maximum fee to
indoor hands is £2. Dressmakers’ hours are
regulated by the Factories and Workshops
Act. The regular day, that is to say, is one
of twelve hours, including meal-times. A
good deal of overtime is unfortunately worked
during the season. An apprentice, whether
paying a premium or not, would be expected
to work these hours; but it is possible she
might be excused the overtime, if special
conditions to that effect were made at the
time of engagement. We do not happen to
be able to recommend a firm of dressmakers
in Brighton.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Emigration.</span>—“<i>Will the Australian
Agents-General be sending out any more girls
from this country to Australia this year, on
the same terms as last year? I am a general
servant, getting £20 a year. Could I do
better in Australia? Do they treat their
servants better out there than here? I do not
like service, but am very fond of housework
and do not mind what I do. Would you
recommend the Cape or Canada in preference
to Australia? I think many of us girls
complain and grumble when we ought to
emigrate instead.</i></p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">A Would-be Emigrant.</span>”<br />
</p>

<p>If it is the conditions of English service
that “A Would-be Emigrant” dislikes and not
the work itself, we think she might very likely
find herself happier in Canada or Australia.
The Cape is less to be recommended, as much
Kaffir labour is employed there and consequently
only very good servants are wanted.
Free passages are given to domestic servants of
good character between the ages of 18 and 40
who wish to emigrate to Western Australia.
Inquiries should be addressed to the Agent-General
for Western Australia, 15, Victoria
Street, London, S.W. To other parts of
Australia there are no free, but some assisted
and nominated passages. To Canada there
are no assisted passages. The emigrant to
Canada should select April as the month in
which to leave. Women should communicate
with the Women’s Protective Immigration
Society, at Quebec, and at 84, Osborne Street,
Montreal, if they think of going to Canada.
Servants in Canada receive the following wages
per month:—Prince Edward Island, £1 to
£1 8s.; Nova Scotia, £1 4s. to £2; New
Brunswick, £1 4s. to £1 12s.; Quebec and
Ontario, £1 4s. to £2 8s.; Manitoba and the
North-West, £1 8s. to £3; and in British
Columbia—where nurse girls mainly are wanted—£2
8s. to £4.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Employment for Middle-Aged Ladies.</span>—“<i>How
can three middle-aged ladies, greatly
reduced in circumstances, best obtain a living?
They could spend about £30 in preparing for
employment, and have an income of £30 per
annum. Some persons have suggested that
they should take a small house at about £50
per annum, and then let apartments; but
these ladies do not feel that they could incur
heavy liabilities or have the responsibility of a
large establishment. They are educated, and
used to keep a ladies’ school.</i>—M. S. S.”</p>

<p>These ladies are quite wise not to spend all
they have on the rental of a house, leaving
themselves nothing for board or servants’
wages. The profits on lodgers are small and
would certainly not cover the expenses of
conducting such an establishment for some
time to come. In our opinion it would be
best for the ladies to separate and to take any
posts that they could fill. They should try to
obtain some kind of employment in the capacity
of matron. Possibly one of them might obtain
the matronship of a workhouse, or of one of
those homes in which young children are
trained. Educated ladies who are equal to
doing some housework are much sought after
to act as “house-mothers” to small colonies
or families of poor children. Matrons are
likewise sought for rescue or preventive homes
for girls. It is for some occupation of this
class that the ladies might wisely offer themselves.
If they fail to obtain such posts on
immediate application in reply to advertisements,
then it would be advisable to spend
some portion of the pounds they have by living
and working for a few years in one of the
London women’s settlements. This is the
best advice that can be offered; but the case
is certainly both sad and difficult.</p>

<h3>STUDY AND STUDIO.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">Beatrice M. Paragreen.</span>—We do not know the
book to which you refer. There is a book, <i>Chapters
on the Art of Thinking</i>, by James Hinton (published
at 8s. 6d.); and another, <i>Three Introductory
Lectures on the Science of Thought</i>, by Professor
Max Müller (published at 2s. 6d.), which might
help you. If you specially want the volume you
name, write to the publisher or author of the book
where it is recommended, asking for details.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eurydice.</span>—Note the error in spelling your pseudonym.
The story of Orpheus is as follows:—Orpheus,
a mythical personage, was supposed to
live before the time of Homer. Presented with the
lyre by Apollo, and taught to use it by the Muses,
he could attract all living creatures, and even trees
and stones, by his enchanting music. When his
wife, Eurydice, was stung by a serpent and died, he
followed her into the abode of Hades, and by the
charm of his lyre won her back from the king of the
regions of the dead. One condition only was
attached to this favour—that Orpheus should not
look upon his recovered wife until they had arrived
at the upper world; but just at the last moment he
did look back, and she was caught away into the
infernal regions once more. The story is often
mentioned in classic literature, and is to be found
in any classical or mythological dictionary. A
charming poem upon the legend, by one of our
readers, first sent for criticism in this column,
appeared in <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own Paper</span> for December,
1898.</p>

<p>K. S. J.—We should think that your copy of <i>The
Mercurie</i>, of July 23rd, 1588, if genuine, is certainly
valuable. Write to the authorities of the British
Museum, London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A May Blossom.</span>—We should advise you to write to
the Secretary, Board of Technical Education, St.
Martin’s Lane, London, W.C. He will answer all
your questions. We fancy the only way to obtain
a situation as technical teacher of any subject, is
to watch for vacancies and apply for them as they
occur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Primrose.</span>—1. Write to the Secretary of the Church
Missionary Society, Salisbury Square, London,
E.C., inquiring for the hymn in question.—2. We
do not think it is customary to have a cake and a
new wedding-ring at a silver wedding. At any rate
we have never heard of the practice in London.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hopeful.</span>—The best course would be for you to
allow the young girl, who has so good a voice, to
attend for a course of training at the Royal Academy
of Music, Royal College of Music, Guildhall School
of Music, or Trinity College, London. For terms
see Answers to Correspondents in <span class="smcap">The Girl’s Own
Paper</span> for May, etc. No correspondence with
a professional singer would be of much use in the
way of tuition. If you had given your address, our
advice might have been more practical. Good
lessons are all-important.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mayflower.</span>—We cannot undertake any criticism
by post (<i>vide</i> rules in June and other numbers).
There is nothing at all original in your verses, and
it would, we fear, be useless for you to think of
publication. At the same time they are a pleasant
exercise for you in composition, and you appear to
have a good ear for rhyme. You should not, however,
change your metre in the middle of a poem,
as you do in “Past and Present” and “Darkness
and Dawn.” In “Spring” you will observe that
“The birds are gaily singing” is a line of different
cadence from “And the birds so bright and gay,”
yet each occupies the same place (second) in the
verse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Blunderer.</span>—Spring again! Your letter is
modest. Blank verse needs to be exceedingly
poetical in order to be satisfactory, as there is no
rhyme to help the ear. The fault of your composition
is a negative one: there is little in the lines to
prevent them from being read as prose, save the
fact of their being placed below one another, and
being of equal length. “Must needs be always
upward sent” is a specially unmusical line. The
metre you use is not appropriate to blank verse,
and if you wish to try again, we should advise you
to write in rhyme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora.</span>—Spring once more! We do not wish to be
unkind, for it is perfectly natural that this season
of the year should inspire a longing to write, and
we sympathise with you in saying “Often I try to
put my thoughts into words, but they fall very far
short of the conception of my brain.” We prefer
your poem on “The Seasons” to those we have
just been criticising, but it is full of expressions
that would not pass muster, <i>e.g.</i>, “her pearly satin
brow,” “the mould of marble cheeks.” The
course of education to “fit you for a literary
career” must be varied and extensive, comprising
an acquaintance with the best literature of your
own country, and of other countries also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gwyneth A. Mansergh.</span>—You might like <i>The Bird
World</i>, by W. H. D. Adams, illustrated by

<h3>MEDICAL.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">A Constant Sufferer.</span>—The liver is a most unfortunate
organ, since it has to bear the brunt not only
of special diseases of its own, but also of many of the
morbid conditions of the stomach and bowels below,
and of the heart and lungs above. But this is not
all. The liver has to suffer for every indiscretion
in diet—a most formidable form of slavery—and
over and above this, it is held responsible for many
complaints with which it has nothing to do. If
you eat too much, too rich food, too often, or too
indigestible food, the liver must suffer. The signs
of “liver complaint” are a feeling of oppression in
the right side of the abdomen; a yellowish tinge
of the skin; headache; weariness and disinclination
for work or exertion of any kind; sleeplessness
and nightmares; constipation, usually, and
general debility. The cause is almost invariably
overeating or overdrinking, combined with a sedentary
occupation. But it may be due to other more
serious causes. The treatment is suggested by the
cause—extra exercise, little to eat, and still less to
drink. There is one drug which is of immense value
in this condition, namely, calomel. Two grains of
calomel with twenty grains of bicarbonate of soda,
and one day’s absolute fasting, will usually cure an
attack of “liver.” Abstemious living will prevent
the attacks from recurring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constant Reader.</span>—Your friend had far better see
her own doctor. It would be a waste of time
to discuss all the possible things from which she
may be suffering, and you tell us nothing which
could lead us to a correct view of her illness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious One.</span>—Your condition is connected with a
feeble circulation. Plenty of digestible food, warm
clothing, and plenty of exercise, will do you more
good than any local application; but the ichthiol
ointment <i>may</i> do something for you.</p></div>


<h3>MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<div class="blockquot_ans">

<p><span class="smcap">An Anxious Sister.</span>—The salary of a London female
sanitary inspector is from £80 to £150 per annum.
In the provinces it is rather less, being from £52 to
£80; in Scotland £52. An excellent position for
both males and females.</p>

<p>A. B. C.—Certainly, Meran, in the Tyrol, is one of the
very first places for the grape cure; but it is so
popular that you should engage apartments or
hotel accommodation some time prior to your visit.
We have made the cure there, and consider it a
beautiful locality. It stands at 1,100 feet above the
sea-level. Should you find Meran too expensive,
try Botzen, also a charming place at Gries, a
suburb, full of shady gardens, and detached villas,
and pensions. Here the “air cure,” as well as
grape cure, is carried out. Should you decide on
Botzen, you had better write to the Hôtel Badl, or
the Schwartze Gries, in the Square Botzen. You
could drive out to Gries from thence, and suit
yourself. One piece of advice will be valuable to
you. Take a less quantity of grapes than the full
amount generally prescribed, and procure from a
doctor or chemist the tooth-powder essential for
the preservation of the teeth. The peculiar acid of
grapes tends to destroy the enamel. Remember
this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minnie.</span>—You will have to commence paying dog
tax as soon as your puppy has passed six months
of age, when you will be charged 7s. 6d. per annum.</p>

<p>B. D.—The address of the “Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals,” is 105, Jermyn Street,
St. James’s, S.W. The secretary is John Colman,
Esq.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rover.</span>—The phrase, “between dog and wolf,” is
applied to the dusk, when there is neither clear
daylight nor darkness. There is the same phrase in
Latin and French, viz., “<i>Inter canem et lupum</i>,”
and “<i>Entre chien et loup</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gloden Carrick.</span>—The origin of the name
“London” is of remote times in English history.
If from the Celtic, it is a corruption of <i>Luan-dun</i>,
“City of the Moon,” which seems appropriate,
considering that, according to tradition, a temple to
Diana—the Moon—stood on the site of St. Paul’s.
Other origins are given for the name; such as
“Lud’s town,” being so called after a mythical
king of Britain (so termed by Dr. Brewer). Stowe,
however, speaks of him as a real character, and
says he repaired the city and built Lud-gate; and
that, in the year 1260, the gate was decorated with
the figures of kings—Lud included. In the time of
Edward VI. the heads of these monarchs were
knocked off—possibly being mistaken for effigies
of saints—and “Queen Mary,” Stowe continues,
“did set new heads upon their bodies again; and
the twenty-eighth of Queen Elizabeth, the gate was
newly and beautifully built, with images of Lud and
others, as before” (<i>Survey of London</i>). Spenser,
in his <i>Faerie Queene</i>, confirms the tradition that
Lud—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“... Built that gate of which his name is hight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By which he lies entombèd solemnly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Janey.</span>—You can buy ready-prepared marking-ink so
cheaply, and it saves so much trouble, that an old-fashioned
recipe for home making seems out of
date. Still, we give one out of our own recipe book,
which is said to be satisfactory. For the ink, take
25 grs. of lunar caustic; ¼ oz. of rain water; and
½ drachm of sap green. To prepare the article
you will need ½ oz. sal. soda, ¼ oz. of gum arabic,
and 2 oz. of rain water, and a little cochineal.
Steep the part to be marked in this preparation.
We have not tried it; but if the ready-made ink be
unsatisfactory, you can but make a trial of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sufferer.</span>—Although you may not have the means
of obtaining the benefit of change of climate and
mineral waters, prescribed for you by your doctor,
there is much you can do—and with a prospect of
cure—at home. Avoid the use of sugar in everything;
use saccharine in your tea, and take exercises
night and morning, to free the contracted muscles
of the arm. Raise the arms from the sides (stretching
them out) twelve or twenty-four times; throw
them upwards, higher than your head, in front of
you. Spread them out on each side, and bring
them up behind your back so as to meet; and
swing round each hand alternately, to clasp it
respectively on each shoulder; turning the head
every time to that side. Whichever of these exercises
hurts you the most, should be repeated the
oftenest. These exercises (and especially with
abstention from sugar) will cure the rheumatism in
your arm and shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ignorant of Etiquette.</span>—It is not necessary to leave
cards for yourself nor for any member of the family
if received by your hostess in person. Certainly
on whatever occasion you are shown into a reception
room, you should be announced by the servant as
you enter. Never send in a card for the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span>—There could be no hard and fast rule as to
the character or amount of a <i>trousseau</i>. All depends
on the wealth and position of the bride’s
parents. She has nothing to prepare for her future
home. That is the husband’s business.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
